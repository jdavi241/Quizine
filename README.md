# Project 1: Quizine

The goal of the project is to create an app that will help us find a restaurant that satisfies our girlfriend. The 'Quizine' app asks users to answer a series of questions based on their preferences. Through a series of calculations, the app provides users with a list of restaurants that best fit. At the same time, when the user clicks on the restaurant, the most recommended dishes and restaurant location information will be displayed on the screen. I believe that with this application, we will no longer worry about making our girlfriend unhappy over food.

## User Story

```
